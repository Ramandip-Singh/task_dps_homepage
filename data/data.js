The staff whether being it teaching faculty or the governesses or the transportation faculty are immensely understanding and supportive. The canteen and mess are appluadable regarding healthy food. The managing committee and principal welcomes the negative points of school with open mind and take the necessary actions in this regard. We are happy the ways the children are being taught the academics and the way to be a better human being in future. A big kudos to the DPS faculty for doing so.' },
